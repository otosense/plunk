# A sampler of apps made with front

## 1) Visualize a store of tagged sounds
* load the dataset by pointing to a folder
* visualize the result
* apply a simple pipeline (chunker -> featurizer -> projector to plane) and visualize the result

## 2) Record/load and play sounds
* load a wav stored locally
* record a sound directly
* visualize the result

## 3) Apply a stored/saved entire pipeline from a catalogue of pipelines
* pick a dataset (here chosen by default)
* choose a ready-made pipeline from a catalogue of useful ones

## 4) Construct step by step a pipeline from a catalogue of options
* add one by one steps to build a pipeline

## 5) Load some dataset (as a wav file), visualize it and apply a standard outlier model, finally visualize the scores
* apply some simple example of outlier model 
* visualize the scores
